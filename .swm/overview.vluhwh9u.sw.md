### Pipelines

Pipelines are objects that abstract most of the complex code from the library, offering a simple API dedicated to several tasks, including Named Entity Recognition, Masked Language Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, Feature Extraction, and Question Answering.

### Data

Data refers to the input and output files used for training and evaluating machine learning models. These files are typically formatted in a specific way, such as having separate files for training, validation, and testing, with input and target data. Data collators are used to batch and preprocess these data elements, ensuring they are in the correct format for model training and evaluation.

### Commands

Commands are specific instructions or functions that can be executed within the transformers library to perform various tasks such as model conversion, downloading, environment setup, and user management. These commands are registered and parsed through a command-line interface (CLI) tool, allowing users to interact with the library efficiently.

### Utils

Utils are a collection of helper functions, constants, and classes designed to simplify common tasks and operations within the codebase. They provide reusable code snippets that handle tasks such as environment variable management, package availability checks, and error handling, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy across the project.
