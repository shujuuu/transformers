title: Understanding Datasets
---
Data Datasets are used to prepare and manage data for training machine learning models. They handle the downloading, processing, and caching of datasets to ensure efficient training workflows.

These datasets can be loaded using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library, which simplifies the process of accessing various datasets.

Specific dataset classes, such as `SquadDataset` and `GlueDataset`, are implemented to handle particular types of data and tasks, providing tailored preprocessing and feature extraction methods.

The datasets are often cached to speed up subsequent training runs, and the caching mechanism ensures that only the first process in distributed training handles the dataset processing, while others use the cached data.

## Specific Dataset Classes

Specific dataset classes, such as `SquadDataset` and `GlueDataset`, are implemented to handle particular types of data and tasks, providing tailored preprocessing and feature extraction methods.

## Caching Mechanism

The datasets are often cached to speed up subsequent training runs, and the caching mechanism ensures that only the first process in distributed training handles the dataset processing, while others use the cached data.

Example of loading a dataset and splitting it into train and test sets using the `load_dataset` function and `train_test_split` method.

# Main functions

There are several main functions in this folder. Some of them are `map`, `to_tf_dataset`, `__init__`, `__getitem__`, and `create_examples_from_document`. We will dive a little into `map` and `to_tf_dataset`.

## map

The `map` function from the ðŸ¤— Datasets library is used to apply a preprocessing function to the entire dataset. It can be configured with the `batched=True` argument to process multiple elements of the dataset simultaneously.

## to_tf_dataset

The `to_tf_dataset` function converts a dataset to the `tf.data.Dataset` format. It is used in conjunction with the `DefaultDataCollator` to prepare the dataset for training in TensorFlow.
