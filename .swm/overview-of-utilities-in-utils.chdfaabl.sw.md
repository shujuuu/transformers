title: Overview of Utilities in Utils
---
Utilities are helper functions and classes designed to simplify and streamline various tasks within the library.

They include functionalities for handling arguments, managing data formats, and dealing with exceptions.

Utilities also encompass special decorators, properties, and other general-purpose tools that enhance code readability and maintainability.

In addition, utilities provide support for version management, logging, and documentation-related tasks.

## Argument handling

Utilities include functions for handling arguments, ensuring that the inputs to various functions and classes are correctly formatted and validated.

## Data format

Utilities manage data formats, converting data between different formats as needed to ensure compatibility and ease of use.

## Exception handling

Utilities provide mechanisms for dealing with exceptions, allowing for graceful error handling and debugging.

## Special decorators and properties

Utilities include special decorators and properties that can be used to modify the behavior of functions and classes, making the code more modular and reusable.
