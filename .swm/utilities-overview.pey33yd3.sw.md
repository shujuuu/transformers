title: Utilities Overview
---
Utilities refer to various helper functions and classes that assist in the overall functionality of the repository.

They provide essential support for tasks such as logging, version management, and handling different object types.

Utilities streamline the development process by offering reusable components that can be leveraged across different parts of the codebase.

They ensure consistency and reduce redundancy by centralizing common operations into dedicated modules.

Utilities play a crucial role in maintaining the efficiency and organization of the code.

Helper Functions Helper functions in the utilities module provide additional functionality that simplifies complex operations, making the code more readable and maintainable.

```python
    Helper function that sets a recorded torch.Tensor method as a HFProxy method that will use the recorded values
    during symbolic tracing.
    """

    def method(self, *args, **kwargs):
        cache = getattr(self.tracer.root, cache_name)
        res = cache.pop(0)
        return res

    method.__name__ = method_name
    bound_method = method.__get__(proxy, proxy.__class__)
    setattr(proxy, method_name, bound_method)


def _wrap_method_for_model_tracing(model, method_name, cache_name):
    """
    Helper function that sets a recorded torch.Tensor method as a torch.Tensor method that will use the recorded values
```
