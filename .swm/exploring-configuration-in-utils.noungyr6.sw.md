title: Exploring Configuration in Utils
---
Configuration refers to the setup and parameters used to define the behavior and attributes of machine learning models.

The base class `PretrainedConfig` implements common methods for loading and saving configurations from local files or directories, or from pretrained model configurations provided by the library.

Each derived configuration class implements model-specific attributes, such as `hidden_size`, `num_attention_heads`, and `num_hidden_layers`.

Text models further implement attributes like `vocab_size`.
